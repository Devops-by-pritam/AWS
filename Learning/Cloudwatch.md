# 📊 AWS CloudWatch

> Think of **CloudWatch** as the **watchman or gatekeeper** for your AWS account. It constantly observes what’s going on with your cloud resources and services.



## 🧐 What is CloudWatch?

AWS CloudWatch is a **monitoring and observability service** that helps you keep track of everything happening in your AWS environment.

You can think of it as the **security camera + alarm system + logbook** of your cloud account. It monitors metrics, logs, and events, and lets you **set alarms**, **visualize performance**, and even trigger automated responses.

---

## 🔍 What CloudWatch Watches

CloudWatch can **monitor activities like:**

- Creating or deleting resources (e.g., launching an EC2 instance)
- Uploading files to S3
- Updating configurations
- Application performance
- API calls and other AWS service usage

In short, **any activity** happening in your cloud environment can be monitored through CloudWatch – making it the **gatekeeper of your cloud account**.

## ✅ Key Features of CloudWatch

### 📈 Monitoring Metrics

- Monitors **default AWS service metrics** (CPU, Disk, Network, etc.)
- Allows you to create **custom metrics** (e.g., memory usage, application-specific data)

### ⏰ Alarms

- You can set **CloudWatch Alarms** to **alert** you when a certain condition is met.
  - Example: If CPU utilization is above 80% for 5 minutes, send an email.
- Alarms can trigger **SNS notifications**, **auto scaling**, or **Lambda functions**.

### 📄 Log Insights

- CloudWatch Logs let you **collect**, **analyze**, and **visualize logs** from AWS services and applications.
- Use **CloudWatch Log Insights** to run queries on your logs for faster troubleshooting.

### 📊 Dashboards

- Create **custom dashboards** to visualize metrics from multiple services in one place.

### 🧮 Custom Metrics

- You can send your own application metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS SDK or CLI.
- Helpful to monitor **things like memory usage**, which is not available by default on EC2.

### 💰 Cost Optimization

- By monitoring resource usage, CloudWatch helps identify **underutilized or overutilized** resources.
- This helps in **cutting down unnecessary costs** by rightsizing your infrastructure.

### 📈 Scaling (via integration)

- CloudWatch **doesn’t scale** resources directly.
- But you can **integrate it with Auto Scaling** to scale resources based on alarm thresholds.
  - Example: Add EC2 instances if average CPU > 70%

## ⏳ How to Set Up an Alarm in CloudWatch

> Here are the basic steps to create a CloudWatch Alarm:

### 🔧 Steps to Create a CloudWatch Alarm

1. **Open CloudWatch Console**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console → CloudWatch

2. **Choose "Alarms"** from the left sidebar

3. Click **"Create alarm"**

4. **Select a Metric**
   - Choose a metric from EC2, S3, RDS, etc.
   - Example: `EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics → CPUUtilization`

5. **Specify the Condition**
   - Set a threshold (e.g., CPUUtilization > 70%)

6. **Configure Actions**
   - Choose actions like sending an SNS email or triggering auto-scaling

7. **Add a Name** for your alarm

8. Review and **Create Alarm**
